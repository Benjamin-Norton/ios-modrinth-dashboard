# Modrinth Publisher Dashboard

An unofficial android app to track your modrinth statistics.

- Uses [Omorphia](https://omorphia.modrinth.com/) for Vue components.
- Uses [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/) to compile the vue web app to android.

## Features

Currently, I plan to have feature parity with the Analytics page on the modrinth website.

## IOS Support

I cannot provide IOS support myself because I do not have any apple devices. However, you can add it yourself. Check the CapacitorJS documentation for information on adding IOS as a build target.
